### Summary
Concise, definitive Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ and Java
At least that's what I thought at the time, but now it's just a place where I will try and push codeforces solutions in Java.

### File Structure
Files are organised in various directories

    - cpp_template: only one file which contians my cpp template from ancient times lol
    - cf-sol-java: this contains contest-wise solutions on code forces
